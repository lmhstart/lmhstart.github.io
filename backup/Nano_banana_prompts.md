A cinematic scene inside a fast food restaurant at night.  
Foreground: a lonely table with {food_items}, and a smartphone shown large and sharp on the table, clearly displaying the uploaded anime/game character image.

Midground: in the blurred background, a couple is sitting together.  
One of them is represented as a cosplayer version of the uploaded character:

The other person is an ordinary human, and they are showing intimate affection (kissing, holding hands, or sharing food).  

Background: large glass windows, blurred neon city lights outside.  
Mood: melancholic, bittersweet, ironic, cinematic shallow depth of field.

> Create a photorealistic, highly detailed PVC character figure, meticulously crafted based on a photograph. The figure stands proudly on a sleek, round plastic base. Behind it, its collectible box features a high-quality print of the original character art. Adjacent to the box, a computer monitor displays the intricate 3D modeling process in Blender, showcasing the digital sculpting and texturing. The entire figure is rendered in a clear, translucent PVC material, giving it an ethereal, ghost-like quality. The scene is set within a professional design studio with soft, diffused indoor lighting that highlights the figure’s form and transparency.
